## Overview
***DWITIC*** is an innovative solution designed to address the challenges associated with waste management and environmental sustainability. DWITIC offers a platform for identification and categorization of waste items. By the power of image recognition algorithms, DWITIC automates the process of waste categorization, enabling users to upload images and scan waste items and receive their composition and classification.

Aligned with ***Sustainable Development Goal 12 – "Responsible Consumption and Production"***, DWITIC promotes sustainable practices by facilitating the proper identification and categorization of waste items. By providing users with actionable information on waste composition and management, DWITIC empowers individuals and organizations to make informed decisions that contribute to responsible consumption and production patterns. DWITIC encourages users to minimize waste generation, and optimize resource utilization.  
 

## Features
- **Upload and Scan**: Upload and scan waste item images for automatic categorization.
  
- **Intelligent Categorization**: Categorize waste items using image recognition.
  
- **Recycling and Reuse Suggestions**: Receive suggestions for recycling or reusing identified waste items.
  
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive interface for easy usage.
  
- **Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Display**: View associated SDGs for waste items, promoting environmental awareness and sustainable practices.  
  
## Techinical Requirements
The following were used to develop DWITIC:
- **C#** - an object-oriented programming language created by Microsoft that runs on the .NET Framework in this study.asd

- **WinForms** - DWITIC was built by utilizing the WinForms framework provided by Microsoft. WinForms facilitated the development of a graphical user interface (GUI) for DWITIC, allowing users to interact with the application through intuitive forms, buttons, and other UI elements.
  
- **ML.NET** - a machine learning framework for .NET developers, was used to implement machine learning functionalities within DWITIC. It provided a set of libraries and tools for training and deploying machine learning models, enabling DWITIC to perform tasks such as image recognition and waste categorization based on visual characteristics.
  
- **Emgu.CV** - a cross-platform wrapper for OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library), was utilized to incorporate computer vision capabilities into DWITIC. It provided access to a wide range of computer vision algorithms and functions, facilitating tasks such as image processing, feature detection, object recognition, and more.
